Melo Chat Server is a real time message-delivery application with socket connections.
We are a Node.js based application that helps you get in touch with your contacts
in a very easy and fast way. At the moment, we can run on all browsers and we offer
a set of different functionalities:

  - Global chat
  - Rooms chats
  - Private chats

In order to be compliant with a fast communication in real time we have decided to 
use Socket.io, a library that enables Client-Server communication: https://socket.io/docs/v4/
This library is very useful along with the Node.js environment because of the number
of events sent in a very short time space. 
We also have used Express for a better performance: https://expressjs.com/es/api.html
And finally, we have also made use of the Moment library so that the messages can
be displayed with a well formatted timestamp: https://momentjs.com/docs/
